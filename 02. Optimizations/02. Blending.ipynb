    "# Mixtures optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction.\n",
    "Mixing type optimizations allow for example to create the least expensive mixture, under cost constraint.It is also possible to maximize or minimize another parameter.\n",
    "In this study, I will use several solvers, and make linear optimizations and not\n",
    "linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I worked on this type of problem for weeks, and the results and codes have been validated because they are the same as Lindo and also the problem of mixture exposed by Marc Sevaux and Christian Prins in the book \"Optimization with Excel\".The proposed code also strictly finds the same solution as that of the Python Pulp designer, in its famous optimization \"The Whiskas Blending Problem\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, percentages are used for mixing problems, which somewhat complicates the code writing with the solver.\n",
    "In addition, we do not necessarily produce 100% of alloy, but this can be a unit value, for example, producing 5000 kgs of an alloy, however, this remains a mixture problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making an optimization of the mixture and obtaining a range of decisions variables whose total is equal to 100% can apply to a large number of optimizations, not necessarily to liquid mixtures!\n",
    "\n",
    "The general principle is this:\n",
    "We have several suppliers for each metal, which have different prices, but their metals have\n",
    "different characteristics (it can be resistance, X content, etc.).The solver will offer us the alloy at the best price.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not at all forced to maximize the profit, we can maximize or minimize another parameter when mixing.\n",
