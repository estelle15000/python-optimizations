    "What are supply chain metrics?\n",
    "Supply chain metrics are ratios, reports or other metrics that help a company understand the performance of its supply chain. Many companies review a variety of supply chain metrics to identify improvement opportunities or increase customer satisfaction. You can categorize these metrics into different sections, such as:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "It measures the number of times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a specific period, typically a year. A higher inventory is usually better, though there may be downsides to a high turnover. \n",
    "\n",
    "A relatively low inventory turnover ratio may be a sign of weak sales or excess inventory, while a higher ratio signals strong sales but may also indicate inadequate inventory stocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost of goods sold (COGS) is also known as cost of sales. \n",
    "Secondly, average value of inventory is used to offset seasonality effects. It is calculated by adding the value of inventory at the end of a period to the value of inventory at the end of the prior period and dividing the sum by 2\n",

    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory_turnover\n",
    "\n",
    "High inventory turnover indicates that items are \"moving fast\" and that inventory levels and associated costs are limited.\n",
    "Conversely, low inventory turnover is often a cause for concern. The items then have significant stock coverage (which can reach several years) The money is tied up unnecessarily, the need for space in the warehouse is high (which harms its productivity) and it is possible that part of these Items are never actually ordered because they are out of date, out of fashion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Higher Inventory Turnover Ratio → The company likely experiences strong demand in the market for its products, as confirmed by the high turnover and the frequent need for inventory replenishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lower Inventory Turnover Ratio → There might be poor demand in the market and excess inventory accumulating (i.e. overstocking). The company’s inventory, if left unsold, might eventually need to be written down to reflect the true (lower) value on the balance sheet.\n",

Given the inventory balances, the average cost of inventory during the year is calculated at $500,000. As a result, inventory turnover is rated at 10 times a year."
