    "\n",
    "- Two events are mutually exclusive or disjoint if they cannot occur at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability that Event A occurs, given that Event B has occurred, is called a conditional probability. The conditional probability of Event A, given Event B, is denoted by the symbol P(A|B).\n",

    "- The complement of an event is the event not occurring. The probability that Event A will not occur is denoted by P(A').\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The probability that Events A and B both occur is the probability of the intersection of A and B. The probability of the intersection of Events A and B is denoted by P(A ∩ B). If Events A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A ∩ B) = 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The probability that Events A or B occur is the probability of the union of A and B. The probability of the union of Events A and B is denoted by P(A ∪ B) .\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the occurrence of Event A changes the probability of Event B, then Events A and B are dependent. On the other hand, if the occurrence of Event A does not change the probability of Event B, then Events A and B are independent.\n"
